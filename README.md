# MCLaunch
A Minecraft Bedrock for Nintendo Switch Mod "removing" the Microsoft login.

Ban safety is unknown.

I've made this because the login "gives up" after one minute before I can join my worlds, and due to the environment I'm using, I cannot just log into my account.

The project uses a different subsdk number ("subsdk8") to easily be used with other mods without changing file names.

Currently supported version: 1.21.20, 1.21.21

Pull requests for other versions are appreciated!
